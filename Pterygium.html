        <h2 class="secH">What is Pterygium?</h2>
        <p class="bigtextPara">Pterygium, commonly referred to as “surfer’s eye,” is a non-cancerous, wing-shaped growth of tissue on the white part of the eye (sclera) that can extend onto the cornea. It usually forms on the side closest to the nose and may grow slowly over time. While mild cases may not cause symptoms, larger or advanced pterygia can distort vision, cause irritation, redness, and affect the appearance of the eye.</p>
        <p class="bigtextPara">The condition is strongly linked to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, wind, dust, and dry environments—making it more common in people who spend a lot of time outdoors without eye protection. Though it is not harmful in the early stages, untreated pterygium can lead to vision issues or recurring inflammation. In more severe cases, surgical removal is recommended to restore clear vision and eye comfort.</p>

      <h2 class="secH">Common Symptoms of Pterygium</h2>
      <p class="bigtextPara">Pterygium may start without noticeable symptoms, but as it progresses, patients may experience various discomforts, including:</p>
      <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
        <li>Redness and eye irritation</li>
        <li>A visible fleshy growth on the white of the eye</li>
        <li>Foreign body sensation or gritty feeling</li>
        <li>Dryness and increased tearing</li>
        <li>Blurred vision (if the growth encroaches on the cornea)</li>
        <li>Itchiness or mild burning sensation</li>
        <li>Cosmetic concerns due to visible tissue on the eye</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These symptoms may worsen with sun exposure, wind, smoke, or air pollution. Regular monitoring is essential to detect progression, especially if the pterygium begins affecting the cornea or altering vision. Artificial tears and protective eyewear can help manage mild symptoms before surgical intervention is needed.</p>

   <p class="maxPara">Though all pterygia share a similar appearance, they are generally classified based on their severity and stage of progression:</p>

            <h3 class="fourthH">Atrophic (Inactive) Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Atrophic pterygium is a thin, flat growth on the white part of the eye, often pale with minimal blood vessels. It usually remains stable, causes no vision problems, and may not require treatment. Symptoms, if present, are mild—like dryness or irritation. Though it doesn’t grow actively, regular monitoring is recommended, especially for people frequently exposed to sun, wind, or dust. Artificial tears and sunglasses can help manage minor discomfort and prevent worsening.</p>

          <div class="typesInfo">
            <h3 class="fourthH">Progressive (Active) Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Progressive pterygium is a thick, red, and inflamed tissue that actively grows from the conjunctiva toward the cornea. It can cause irritation, a foreign body sensation, and blurred vision if it encroaches on the visual axis. This type may worsen rapidly due to UV exposure or dry conditions. Early treatment with lubricants, anti-inflammatory drops, and lifestyle adjustments may help slow progression. In advanced cases, surgery may be necessary to prevent corneal distortion and permanent vision problems.</p>

            <h3 class="fourthH">Recurrent Pterygium</h3>
            <p>Recurrent pterygium refers to regrowth of the tissue after surgical removal. It often appears more aggressive than the original and may grow faster with more inflammation and scarring. Symptoms typically include redness, discomfort, and visual disturbance. Risk of recurrence is higher in younger patients and in areas with high UV exposure. Close postoperative monitoring and proper surgical technique using conjunctival grafts or anti-scarring agents can reduce recurrence rates and improve long-term outcomes.</p>

          <h3 class="fourthH">Refractive Error Risk Factors:</h3>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Genetics and family history</li>
            <li>Excessive screen time or near work</li>
            <li>Aging (especially for presbyopia)</li>
            <li>Eye trauma or injury</li>
            <li>Unmanaged medical conditions like diabetes</li>

          </ul>
          <h3 class="fourthH">LASIK Limitations & Cautions:</h3>
          <p>While LASIK is highly successful, not everyone is a candidate. Risks include dry eyes, glare, under- or over-correction, and rare complications like flap dislocation or infection. It’s not advised for individuals with thin corneas, autoimmune disorders, advanced glaucoma, or unstable prescriptions. A detailed pre-op assessment helps minimize risks and ensures safe, customized treatment.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Diagnosis of Refractive Errors & LASIK Procedure</h2>
          <h3 class="fourthH">Diagnosis:</h3>
          <p>A complete eye exam is used to diagnose refractive errors and assess LASIK eligibility. It includes:</p>
          <ul class="UlStyle">
            <li><strong>Refraction test: </strong> Measures the eye’s focusing ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Corneal topography: </strong> Maps the surface shape of the cornea.</li>
            <li><strong>Pupil size and tear film evaluation: </strong> Ensures safety and precision in surgery.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="fourthH mt-4">LASIK Procedure:</h3>
          <p>The LASIK surgery is painless and takes about 15 minutes per eye. A laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea, which is gently lifted. A second laser then reshapes the underlying corneal tissue to correct the refractive error. The flap is repositioned without the need for stitches. Most patients experience rapid visual improvement, with stable results achieved within a few weeks.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Post-LASIK Care Tips</h2>
          <p>Following LASIK surgery, proper care is essential for a smooth recovery and to maintain clear vision:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Use prescribed eye drops to prevent infection and reduce dryness</li>
            <li>Avoid rubbing or touching your eyes</li>
            <li>Wear protective eye shields while sleeping for the first few days</li>
            <li>Avoid makeup, swimming, or dusty environments for at least a week</li>
            <li>Take breaks from screens and bright lights initially</li>
            <li>Attend all follow-up appointments to monitor healing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mild discomfort, sensitivity to light, or watery eyes may occur in the first 24 hours. These usually resolve quickly with proper care. Most patients can resume normal routines within 2–3 days but should avoid strenuous activities for a week.</p>

          <h2 class="thirdH mb-4">Vision Care & Prevention Tips</h2>
          <p>Though LASIK offers long-term correction, maintaining eye health is vital for lifelong visual clarity. Here are some tips:</p>
          <ul class="UL_Points ps-4 mb-4">
            <li>Follow the 20-20-20 rule to reduce digital eye strain</li>
            <li>Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamin A, lutein, and omega-3 fatty acids</li>
            <li>Wear sunglasses with UV protection outdoors</li>
            <li>Keep up with annual eye check-ups, even after LASIK</li>
            <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake</li>
            <li>Manage chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure</li>
            <li>Ensure good lighting when reading or working</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Practicing these habits can help prevent future eye strain, protect vision health, and prolong the benefits of LASIK surgery.</p>
